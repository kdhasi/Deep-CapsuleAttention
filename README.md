## Pytorch Implementation of Low Resolution Image Classification Using Capsule Attention

Official Implementation of "Deep Hybrid Architecture for Very Low-Resolution Image Classification Using Capsule Attention" paper. The manuscript is available here.

This repo provides the codes for all the models introduced in paper together with the pre-trained weights on our own dataset for the deeper variants.

The current test accuracy on VLR CIFAR10 = 79.90%.
